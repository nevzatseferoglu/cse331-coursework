
Instructions in instruction memory:
------------
1: jal 10 -> 00001100
	     00000000
             00000000
             00001010

45 : addn R3, R2, R1

--------
*First instruction in the instruction memory. Therefore R[31] should 4 after jumping and linking.
*At the line 45(estimated jump), there is an other instruction in instruction memory to test whether
jal is works or not.

*At the line 45 there is an another helper test instruction in instruction memory that helps me tot test:

addn R3, R2, R1
00000000
01000001
00011000
00100000

Initial contents:

R1 content = 00000000000000000000000000000011
R2 content = 00000000000000000000000000000010
R3 content = 00000000000000000000000000000000
R31 content = 00000000000000000000000000000000

*Note = All the other registers are filled with zero.
