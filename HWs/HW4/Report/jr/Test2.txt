
Instructions in instruction memory:
------------
1: jr R2 00100000
	 01000000
         00000000
         00000000

53: addn R4, R3, R1

--------
*At the line 53(estimated jump), there is an other instruction in instruction memory to test whether
jr is works or not.

*At the line 53 there is an another helper test instruction in instruction memory that helps me tot test:

addn R4, R3, R1
00000000
01100001
00100000
00100000


Initial contents:

R1 content = 00000000000000000000000000000010
R2 content = 00000000000000000000000000110100 (decimal 52) because lines are start with 1.
R3 content = 00000000000000000000000000000011
R4 content = 00000000000000000000000000000000

*Note = All the other registers are filled with zero.
